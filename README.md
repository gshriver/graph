# graph
simple graph class implementation in c++
Author: Greg Shriver

My reason for writing this was to build a somewhat reusable graph class for use in solving Hackerrank graph problems
(where libraries such as boost are not present)
Another reason was to practice creating objects, classes and methods in c++.
If I were really trying to make a robust, STL-like graph implementation, I would templatize it and add iterators.
But it seems silly to do so when libraries like the Boost Graph Library already exist.

So, use this class, use it to learn about graph algorithms, or not.
You may want to check out the Boost Graph Library: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/graph/doc/ 
before choosing to use this class.
